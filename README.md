# Crime and Punishment Reference Notes

These reference notes were copied from the end of [Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky as translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky](https://www.amazon.com/Crime-Punishment-Fyodor-Dostoyevsky-ebook/dp/B08HJ52DL5/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1609629907&sr=8-2).  The Kindle version that I'm reading references these notes but doesn't provide hyperlinks to the notes themselves.  So, having an external copy of the notes to use while reading comes in handy.
